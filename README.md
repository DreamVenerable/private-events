# Project: Private events


* In this project, I will be learning how to use ActiveRecord’s associations.


### Project description: 
- A user can create events. 
- A user can attend many events.
- An event can be attended by many users. 
- Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which can just be stored as a string, e.g “Andy’s House”).
